Why should we use it?

Speed
- Updating and manipulating the DOM is slow.
- React makes updates fast by only changing what needs to be changed

Reuse
- Promotes reusable components that can be shared across projects
- Use composition to piece together components into larger views

Flux
- If you're unfamiliar, its an architecture built around the idea of unidirectional data flow
- Unidirectional data flow leads to predictability in your app
- Don't need to use Flux to use React but they go really well together

Learning
- React has a gradual learning curve
- Easy to start and build on your knowledge as you go

Tooling
- Lots of great tools for debugging (React dev tools)
- Works really well with modern build tools like webpack
- create-react-app makes setting up a project really easy

Community
- React has a large and very active community
- Tons of great information out there
- Lots of good conferences and talks
