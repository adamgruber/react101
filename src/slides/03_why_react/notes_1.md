### Why Use React?

### => Speed
- DOM is slow

- React changes only what needs to be changed

### => Reuse
- Components can be shared across projects

- Use composition to assemble larger views

### => Flux
- Architecture built on idea of unidirectional data flow

- Predictability

- Don't need to use Flux but React works really well with it

### => Learning
- Gradual learning curve

- Build on knowledge as you go

### => Tooling
- Debugging (React dev tools)

- Modern JS build tools (webpack)

- CLIs for bootstrapping (create-react-app)

### => Community
- Large, very active

- Conferences, talks

- Tons of great information
