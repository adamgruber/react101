In February 2010, Facebook released XHP, an extension to PHP.

It's main goal was preventing XSS and it did this by augmenting the PHP syntax to make PHP understand XML.

With XHP you no longer need to handle string escaping.

It also introduced the ability to create custom tags that could then be reused and composed to create larger components.

We'll come back to this point in a bit.
