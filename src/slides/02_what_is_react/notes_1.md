So what is React?
- A library for building user interfaces
- It is NOT a framework

It's... Declarative
- Instead of manually manipulating the DOM we declare the state of our application and React handles rendering and updating

It's... Component-Based
- Components are encapsulated and can manage their own state
- Can be composed to make more complex UIs
- No need to track state in the DOM

It can be... Used Anywhere
- Because it is a library, it can be added to existing projects and live alongside legacy code
- Can be rendered on the server with Node
- Can be used to develop mobile apps with React Native
