Letâ€™s dive right in and build our first component.

You may think that in order to use React we have to use certain tools and set up a build process and learn all this new stuff. Not so.

- Start with a basic HTML shell (adapted from create-react-app)
- Create a component (react.createElement())


I want to show you another way to write this component using a syntax called JSX.

Now, this might look kind of strange and you may be thinking, "why are you writing HTML inside JavaScript?".

So let's talk about JSX for a minute.
