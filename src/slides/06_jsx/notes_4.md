Regardless of how you feel about it, some things to note:

- JSX is NOT writing HTML in JS
- JSX expressions evaluate to React Elements (React.createElement())
- JSX is not an HTML template language

So give it a try and decide for yourself.

Personally I like JSX so I'll be using it in the rest of the examples.
