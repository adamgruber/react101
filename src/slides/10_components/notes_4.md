TickTock example

To work we have to do 2 things
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Pass in current time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Call `tick` function to render

Encapsulate this functionality?

Ideal clock component?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Know the time
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Tick on its own
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Start when rendered
