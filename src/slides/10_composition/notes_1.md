Now that we know how to create components. Let's see how we can combine them to make more complex components. This is called "composition."

Say we ran an interstellar delivery company and needed an app to track our crew.
And the app is just a simple list of crew members.

Now space deliveries can be dangerous so we want to keep track of who's still part of the crew and who needs to be replaced. We can break this UI into reusable chunks to make it easier to implement.
