Hi, thanks for coming, etc.

So this is going to b a *brief* introduction to React.

Chances are you've heard of React or at least heard it around the office.
I know some of you have used React. My hope is that at then end of this talk
you'll have a better understand of
- What React is
- Where it came from
- The benefits and why we use it

We'll also get into a few live coding examples.
